LMLyzer â€“ Lightweight CLI Tool for LLM Benchmarking
I independently developed LMLyzer, a CLI-based benchmarking tool designed for researchers and developers working with large language models (LLMs). The tool automates the process of evaluating model performance, especially focusing on load time, memory usage, GPU utilization, generation time, and resource consumption comparison across models. Instead of writing separate scripts, users can run simple commands to benchmark multiple models efficiently. It also supports detailed report generation, 
making it highly useful for both research and production-level diagnostics.
