***LLMLYZER***	

 **LMLyzer is an open-source language model benchmarking tool specially focused on memory usage and time complexity benchmarking. The word LMLyzer comes from Language Model + Analyzer.**

It is a command-line interface tool — just download it using the setup file, and you're good to go.

Users can benchmark and analyze different kinds of language models just by using commands.

It's not necessary to create separate scripts for separate tasks and manage them, remember their location, etc.

Users and researchers just have to remember commands and can easily analyze and compare LLM models in the following areas:

Loading time

Memory usage

GPU usage

CPU usage

Generation time

Compare models overall

Create reports

Generate graphs and rank models




Availability

***Currently, it is 60% complete, and updates are coming regularly.
Benchmarking LLMs and comparing them is very crucial for analysis,

so I thought — why do we have to create separate scripts for automation?***

***These are just simple examples,***
like:

Loading time analysis

Resource usage

Text generation time

GPU usage time, etc.

can be modified..

I'm still working on it. Hope you like it!
If you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me directly.
